 - sort stats by method:name to ease comparisons
 - optionally log all requests to file specified with `--stats-log-file=`

## 0.8.0 June 26, 2020
 - properly subtract previous statistic when handling `set_failure()` and `set_success()`
 - detect and track redirects in `GooseRawRequest`
 - `--sticky-follow` makes redirect of GooseClient base_url sticky, affecting subsequent requests
 - changed `GooseClient` to `GooseUser`
